Card006;Cams basic+;Describe the three broad zones of how we can classify AWS Services relationship with the internet;1. We have the Private Zone.

Card015;Cams basic+;What is the difference between CloudFormation Templates and a CloudFormation Stack;A CloudFormation Template is a yaml or json file that specifies the Logical Resources as inputs to the Cloud Formation Service. The CloudFormation service creates an internal representation of this called a CloudFormation Stack which maps the Logical Resources in a CF template to the Physical Resources created by Cloud Formation.; CloudFormation Fundamentals

Card019;Cams cloze+;If a lambda function is CPU or network bound how can you increase it's performance?<br>a) Update the DPU allocation<br>b) It can only be split into more workloads<br>c) Increase it's memory allocation as CPU scales with memory<br>d) Request to run on a different hypervisor<br>Correct:{{c1:: c}}<br>;; Lambda
Card020;Cams cloze+;How are lambdas charged for?<br>a) CPU + Network + Memory Usage per run<br>b) Priced per 1000 invocations<br>c) CPU time per function<br>d) Total amount of gigabyte-seconds per function<br>Correct:{{c1:: d}}<br>;; Lambda
Card021;Cams cloze+;What is true of the isolation model for the Lambda service?<br>a) A single Lambda invocation runs in multiple execution environments<br>b) An execution environment is discarded after its Lambda invocation finishes <br>c) There are no shared file storage between lambda invocations<br>d) Execution environments run on MicroVMs dedicated to a single AWS Account<br>Correct:{{c1:: d}}<br>;; Lambda

Card023;Cams cloze+;When is Memory leakage between lambda invocations possible?<br>a) It is never possible. The lambda service scrubs memory between each invocation.<br>b) When using third party libraries in multiple invocations in the same execution environment.<br>c) Global Variables and objects stored in the INIT phase<br>d) Only when the lambda warm start feature is enabled.<br>Correct:{{c1:: b is the answer. C is true but not the answer. Others are just wrong}}<br>;; Lambda
